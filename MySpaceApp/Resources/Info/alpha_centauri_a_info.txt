Alpha Centauri A calls the Centaurus constellation home. It is known by many other names including Rigil Kent. Alpha Centauri is the nearest star system to the Sun and is located 4.37 light-years from Earth; 25.8 trillion miles (41.5 trillion kilometers). It is considered a circumpolar South star of latitude 29 degrees South, which means it never sets below the horizon in that area of the world. This is also one of the stars that point to the Southern Cross asterism.
