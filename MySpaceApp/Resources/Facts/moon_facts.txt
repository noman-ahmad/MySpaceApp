2. The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It goes around the Earth at a distance of about 239,000 miles (385,000 kilometers).

3. The Earth and Moon are tidally locked. Their rotations are so in sync we only see one side of the Moon. Humans didn't see the lunar far side until a Soviet spacecraft flew past in 1959.

4. The Moon has a solid, rocky surface cratered and pitted from impacts by asteroids, meteorites, and comets. 

5. The Moon has a very thin and tenuous atmosphere called an exosphere. It is not breathable.

6. The Moon has no moons.

7. The Moon has no rings.

8. More than 105 robotic spacecraft have been launched to explore the Moon. It is the only celestial body beyond Earth – so far – visited by human beings.

9. The Moon's weak atmosphere and its lack of liquid water cannot support life as we know it.

10. Apollo astronauts brought back a total of 842 pounds (382 kilograms) of lunar rocks and soil to Earth. We are still studying them.
